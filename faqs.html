            No, you don't have to worry about capitalizing names, this
            application has been designed in such a way that if you miss a
            capital letter you don't need to worry. All names will be displayed
            capitalized and all customer data will remain intact regardless of
            what format you use to input customers with. Go nuts!!

            what is this horrible application and how do i use it?

            I'm glad you asked! This customer queue system is designed to make
            using it as easy as possible. Simply click a button to get the
            corrisponding effect listed on that button. The "Add Customers"
            button is your starting point, upon clicking it you can add as many
            customers as you please. Make sure you click ok between each
            customer, then simply type done when you're finished and click ok.
            PLEASE NOTE: WHEN RECOVERING OLD CUSTOMERS YOU MAY ONLY RECOVER AND
            CYCLE THOSE CUSTOMERS ONCE. ALL CUSTOMERS WILL BE LOST AFTERWARD AND
            YOU MUST START OVER.

            why can't you make it so that i can recover and use old customer
            data indefinetly? what is going on behind the scenes?

            Two more fantastic questions! To keep things simple, when you add a
            customer to the queue you are actually populating three separate
            variables, two of those variables are for you to manupulate, the
            last variable however is MINE!! Also, there is no need to recover
            customers indefinetly, simply add the ones you've missed via the Add
            Customers button while staring at the reference queue and things
            should work out ok.

            you're kind of a jerk. don't you have a social life? can i meet you
            and punch your stupid face?

            My apologies if I've come off as rude, that was not my intention. I
            tried to make this application as user friendly as I could so that
            there is less work involved for you to use it. Feedback is always
            welcome and appreciated. Please jot any questions, comments or
            concerns on a small card and when/if you see me, hand me that card
            personally. I will apply the changes if I can.
